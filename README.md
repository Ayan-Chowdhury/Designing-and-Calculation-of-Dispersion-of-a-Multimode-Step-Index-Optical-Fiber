# Designing-and-Calcution-of-Dispersion-of-a-Multimode-Step-Index-Optical-Fiber
A Multimode Step Index optical fiber has been designed having 50 and 120 micrometer of diameter for core and cladding respectively. The wavelength has been increased gradually to detect the Attenuation and Dispersion might occur.
